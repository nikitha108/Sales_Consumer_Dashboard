# Sales & Customer Dashboard ðŸ“Š

## Overview

Welcome to the Sales & Customer Dashboard, where data comes to life in Tableau! This project is all about turning raw data into insightful stories. By combining two interactive dashboardsâ€”Sales Insights and Customer Analyticsâ€”it gives you a detailed look at the pulse of the business. Whether you're a sales manager, marketer, or data enthusiast, this project helps you visualize trends, understand customer behavior, and make better data-driven decisions.

## Whatâ€™s Inside: Dashboard Breakdown
### The Sales Dashboard
If you want to see how your sales are really doing, this dashboard is your best friend. It's a quick and easy way to spot performance trends, see what products are flying off the shelves, and figure out which weeks could use a little extra push.

- **KPI Overview**: Key metrics such as total sales, profits, and quantities for both current and past years are presented for a quick snapshot.
- **Sales Trends**: Get a look at monthly sales figures, comparing year-over-year data to see whatâ€™s been going up, down, or sideways.
- **Product Subcategory Comparison**: This section gives you the breakdown of how individual product categories are doing, helping you understand where the profits are hiding.
- **Weekly Sales Trends**: A look at weekly sales and profits, so you can see exactly which weeks were star performers (or which ones, letâ€™s say, were "quiet").
### The Customer Dashboard
This oneâ€™s for anyone who wants to understand customer behavior in a little more depth. From loyal buyers to occasional visitors, this dashboard helps you visualize key customer data and trendsâ€”vital for marketing campaigns and customer retention strategies.

- **KPI Overview**: Here, you'll get the total number of customers, sales per customer, and the total number of orders for current and previous years.
- **Customer Trends**: A month-by-month comparison of customer-related KPIs, so you can spot trends and seasonal changes.
- **Customer Distribution by Orders**: Ever wondered how your customers are divided between those who buy once and those who keep coming back? Now you know.
- **Top 10 Customers by Profit**: A spotlight on your highest-paying customers. Because letâ€™s face it, they deserve some attention (and maybe a thank-you card).
Design & Interaction: Letâ€™s Keep It Smooth
User-Friendly Design
The focus of the dashboard is to make your data easy to digest. After all, the best insights are the ones that donâ€™t make you squint. The layout is designed with mockups for each dashboard to ensure that everything is in its place. Clean, clear, and structured, so you never lose track of the story the data is telling.


## Development Process: From Idea to Execution
### 1. Defining Whatâ€™s Needed
Before building anything, I made sure to understand what the dashboards needed to achieve. Through mockups and brainstorming, I created a visual map of where each component would live and how it would function.

### 2. Data Setup
Once the design was locked, it was time to connect to the data. I set up a structured data model in Tableau, cleaned up the data, and made sure everything was labeled and formatted properly. Accuracy here is keyâ€”after all, wrong data doesnâ€™t make for great dashboards.

### 3. Crafting Visualizations
With the data in place, I created the charts and visualizations. This was all about making the data easy to understand. Removing unnecessary gridlines, cleaning up axes, and applying colors that make sense were all part of the process. I also added tooltips to make sure the charts were as informative as possible.

### 4. Assembling the Dashboards
I brought everything together by creating a flexible container layout that can accommodate various charts and visuals. Adjusted sizing, colors, and spacing were finalized, and I made sure all elements fit nicely within the "Entire View" setting. The finishing touch? Interactive filters and easy navigation icons that make jumping between the dashboards seamless.
